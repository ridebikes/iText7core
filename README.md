This is an example of how to make a PDF from scratch, merge, strip, save, scale, rotate, convert to text and split.
Make a PDF is to create a brand new PDF from nothing.
Merge is put pdf's together, and add a comment where a new one was created.
Strip will take all the comments out and save it.
Scale and Rotate will adjust the pages.
Convert to text will output a text file containing the PDF text.
Split will take a list you create of pages you want and output filenames, and split the pdf up however you like by page ranges.
